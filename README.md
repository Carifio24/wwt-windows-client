## Installation

Most folks should download the official WWT releases here:

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/>

You only need to clone this repository if you’re interested in hacking the
source code to the WWT application yourself. If that describes you, WWT is a C#
application buildable with Visual Studio 2018 or 2019. In order to build the
installer, you’ll need to install the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer
Projects][mvsip] extension for Visual Studio.
