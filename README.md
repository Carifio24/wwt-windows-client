# AAS WorldWide Telescope Windows Client

The “windows client” of the [AAS](https://aas.org/) [WorldWide
Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) lets you explore the
universe from the comfort of your chair! Learn more about WWT
[here](https://worldwidetelescope.org/home).


## Installation

Most folks should download the official WWT releases here:

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/>

You only need to clone this repository if you’re interested in hacking the
source code to the WWT application yourself. If that describes you, WWT is a C#
application buildable with Visual Studio 2018 or 2019.
