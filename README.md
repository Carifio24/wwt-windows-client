# WorldWide Telescope Windows Client
WorldWide Telescope (WWT) enables you to explore the universe, bringing together imagery from the best ground- and space-based telescopes in the world and combining it with 3D navigation, data visualization, and more.  Please see [OpenWWT.org](http://openwwt.org/) for an overview.

This repository contains the source code for the WWT Windows Client.  You will need Visual Studio 2013 with the Setup/Deployment add in to build the code and setup.

Because of GitHub's 100mb file limit you will also have to unzip the datafiles for setup (see [Setup1/ReadMe.txt](Setup1/ReadMe.txt)).

Source code for the OpenWWT web client, and for the supporting website and tools, are located in other repositories:
